# Summary 
This application was one of my favorite so far. Here, I felt more comfortable working with functions and methods. It was definitely a challenging project, starting with SCC grid layout, combined with intricacies of JavaScript logic. Time spent on it was more than rewarding. Feel free to enjoy the application.
